Time is displayed in a 24 hour clock format.<br>Past present and future are color coded so users can easily what time it currently is, what events have expired, and what events are still yet to be done.<br>Gray indicates past, red present, green future. All events persist when the page is refreshed, so users don't have to worry about their tasks being lost.
